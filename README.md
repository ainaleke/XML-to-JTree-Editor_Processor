# XML to JTree Editor/Processor
This app converts and parses an XML file both on the local system and on the Internet into a JTree(Hierarchical) format  for editing and processing using JDOM
You will need to download and import JDOM libraries/JAR into your project to get it to work.
Hope you enjoy it.
